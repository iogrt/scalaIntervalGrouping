# Scala Exercise: Interval counting

## Exercise prompt:
The purpose of this exercise is to check if older products are still being sold. Consider the following entities:

- Order: contains general information about the order (customer name and contact, shipping address, grand total, date when the order was placed, ...)

- Item: information about the purchased item (cost, shipping fee, tax amount, ...)

- Product: information about the product (name, category, weight, price, creation date, ...)

These entities are all related: one order contains several items and each item has a product.

Please implement a tool that receives an interval and filters all orders placed during that interval.

The **result should be a list of intervals** (in months) that groups the orders **based on the product age** (creation date field in the product entity). If we have orders in the older intervals, it means that older products are still being sold.

### Example:
```bash
$ java -jar orders.jar "2018-01-01 00:00:00" "2019-01-01 00:00:00"
```

### Result:
```
1-3 months: 200 orders

4-6 months: 150 orders

7-12 months: 50 orders

>12 months: 20 orders
```

### Bonus feature:

Add an argument to this tool that allow us to pass a list of intervals instead of having the fixed intervals defined above (“1-3”, “4-6”, “7-12”, “>12”)

### Implementation details:

This exercise should be implemented in Scala.
